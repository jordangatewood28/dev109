  <h1>1. What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>My previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript was very minimal at best.</li>
    <li>I have done Javascript in middle school, but I had a hard time understanding it.</li>
    <li>I thought about mentioning it if I haven't in the beginning of the quarter, but it was so long ago that it's considered irrelevant.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>2. Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>I used a template to build my protfolio.</li>
    <li>The main reason why is because I did not have a lot of time due to my job and other classes I have going on.</li>
    <li>The secondary reason is because it was much easier to use a template and improve on it.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>3. What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The most challenging part about my portfolio is the "contacts" tab.</li>
    <li>The only part that works is it takes you directly to the "Thank you" page. The warning for the name used to work, but now it doesn't.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>4. How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>It sort of did and didn't change my view on Web Development at the same time.</li>
    <li>I thought web development was much harder as you're doing so much and I was not aware that there were front-end and back-end developers.</li>
    <li>However, as I learned it, I find some parts were easy, but most were difficult and I have considered my choice in major.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>5. What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>READ, READ, READ!!!</li>
    <li>Find ways to practice your coding skills (I know HTML and CSS aren't coding, but I have no other ways to describe it). Don't just do the class and be done with it like I do. I am still looking for ways to practice it on my own time.</li>
    <li>While looking at examples are fine, it is best to make your own from scratch to get a better feel for it. It will also give it a unique flavor.</li>
  </ul>
