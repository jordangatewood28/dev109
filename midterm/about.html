		<h1>About me</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Hello, my name is Jordan Gatewood. You may call me however you like. I am a 23 year old deaf man aspiring to be a game developer. Originally, I wanted to join the military, primarily as a sailor of sorts or a tanker in the Army and at one point, a pilot! However, my hearing loss prevented any of that happeneing and if I could, I likely wouldn't be allowed to fly. I am currently a full time student at Bellevue College and a box truck driver in training. My current goals is to get a Bachelor's in Software Development and get a stable career and eventually into game development. Mainly because I want to make game about realistic air combat (not necessarily a simulator like Microsoft Flight simulator) and various others things that hasn't been done in game.</p>
